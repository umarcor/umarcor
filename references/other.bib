  abstract={Transferring data between mutually asynchronous clock domains requires safe synchronization. However, the exact nature of synchronization sometimes eludes designers, and as a result synchronization circuits get "optimized" to the point where they do no longer operate correctly. This paper reviews a number of such cases, analyzes the causes of the errors, and offers a correct synchronizer circuit for each case. A correct two flop synchronizer is presented. After discussing cases that avoid synchronization, the following synchronizers are reviewed: one flop, sneaky path, greedy path, wrong protocol, global reset, async clear, DFT leakage, pulse, slow-to-fast, metastability blocker, parallel and shared flop synchronizers.},

  title={Metastability and Synchronizers: A Tutorial},
  year={2011},
  volume={28},
  number={5},
  pages={23-35},
  abstract={Metastability can arise whenever a signal is sampled close to a transition, leading to indecision as to its correct value. Synchronizer circuits, which guard against metastability, are becoming ubiquitous with the proliferation of timing domains on a chip. Despite the critical importance of reliable synchronization, this topic remains inadequately understood. This tutorial provides a glimpse into the theory and practice of this fascinating subject.},
